BLSS is the fasest/most reliable movemnt glitch that I know of. The only one that can move you faster is bokoblin bouncing however this is a unreliable and is hard to execute efficiently.  

## How to BLSS

Step 1 Bow smugle.
For this you will place down a bomb then you will hold out your shield. Well your shield is out you will press ZL then A in quick sucsession if done correctly you will be holding the bow and bomb above your head.

Step 2 The hard part.
This is the hard part and in 9 times out of 10 if you fail this part you have to do step one over again.
